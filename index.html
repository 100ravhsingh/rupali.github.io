	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		ITI basically stands for Industrial Training Institute, is a govt. training institute responsible for providing industry ready training to students after 10th (some trades can be applied after 8th too).<br>

There are various courses running in them better known as “trades” viz. Electrician, Fitter, Mechanic Tractor, RAC etc. The lenght of courses are mostly 24 months with 4 semesters in them (courses of 1 year or 2 semesters are available too).<br>

The institutes are governed by DGET at the central level with states running under its directions. However the states too can run courses at their level.<br>

The state provide SCVT certificates for courses run by them and the former provide NCVT certificates.
<br>
Always prefer NCVT certificates over SCVT as they are valid all over India whereas SCVT certificates are mostly accepted in the state itself.
